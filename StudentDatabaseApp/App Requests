Student Database Application:

You are a Database Administrator for a University and need to create an application 
to manage student enrollments and balance

The application should do the following:
- ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- prompt the user to enter the name and year of each student
- the student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- a student can enroll in the following courses:
	- History 101
	- Mathematics 101
	- English 101
	- Chemistry 101
	- Computer science 101
- each course costs $600 to enroll
- the student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- to see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance
